# HYPED Base-Station Frontend
This repo holds all the code responsible for the frontend of the HYPED base-station frontend, and is included as a submodule in [the repo for the backend](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/base-station-2019). It is a single page React app that connects to the backend through a websocket and communicates over the STOMP protocol.

### How to run
There is no need to 'run' the frontend, it is already packaged together in a jar file with the backend. Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/base-station-2019/releases) and follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/Hyp-ed/base-station-2019/blob/master/README.md). 

### How to build/develop
Clone the repo and run `yarn start`. Go to `localhost:3000` to see a development build, update the files in the repo and you should see an instantaneous change.
